Website Project for Senior Project 


Project Overview: This project is a collaborative effort between 6 class members in ITC 400. The project is a website repository for multiple charity sites. There are two kinds of sites: Listing sites, and functional sites. Listing sites comprise the bulk of the .html files in this project and are all the different charities the group has researched and written about. Functional sites are the homepage and contact page for the project. 

Project Uses: If this were a real-world project intended to be published on a professional level, the site would serve as a concise and compact description of multiple charities around the globe. Information that users could gather from this website would be charity mission statements, goals, and % measurements of how much of a charity's donation amount would go towards the actual cause, where the remainder left would be understood as overhead cost (administration, charity costs, etc.). 

Getting Started: To use this webpage and all of its features, please visit https://proffet9029.github.io/senior-project/ on your preferred browser, as this is the link to the main page. If you would like to view individual pages, download the .html file you have selected (or if you hold the entire source .zip file, find the selected .html file) and open it in your preferred browser. If users find charities not included in the current list, users would need to create a new HTML file and name it to best represent the name of the charity. Then, the user can create a page from one of the currently existing websites or make their own website in HTML. Finally, once a page is created, users can add charities to the search function by adding it under the const pages section in index.html.
